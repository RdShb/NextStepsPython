## Los programas presentes en este repositorio fueron creados para resolver los siguientes problemas:

1. Create a Python program that accepts a date as a string in the format "dd/mm/yyyy" and returns the date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", with the year first. 

   The program must handle exceptions in case the string is not in the correct format. 

2. Create a program that asks the user for their time zone and displays the current time in that zone.

   The program should handle exceptions in case the entered time zone is not valid. 

3. Create a Python program that takes a string and returns the number of words it contains. 

   The program must use a while loop to walk through the string and count the words. 

4. Create a program that prompts the user for a time in "hh:mm" format, then calculates and displays the time in 24 hours (for example, "19:30" would become "19:30"). 

   The time must be validated to ensure that it is in the correct format and that the hours and minutes are integers. 

5. Create a Python program that accepts a string and returns the string reversed (for example, "hello" would become "aloh"). 

   The program must use a for loop to iterate through the string and construct the string inverted. 

6. Create a program that prompts the user for an integer and then calculates and displays the sum of all numbers from 1 to the entered number. 

   The program must use a for loop to add the numbers. 

7. Create a program that prompts the user for a string of characters and then prints each character on a separate line. 

   The program must use a for loop to walk through the string. 

8. Create a Python program that accepts a list of strings and returns a new list containing only strings that are longer than 5 characters. 

   The program must use a for loop to traverse the list and a control flow structure to filter the strings. 

9. Create a Python program where the input is a string, a word and a replacement word, the output should be the string with all occurrences of the word replaced by another word. 

   The program must use a while loop to find all occurrences of the word and replace them. 

10. Create a Python program that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain at least one vowel. 

    The function must use a for loop to traverse the list and a control flow structure to filter the strings.

11. Create a Python program that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the numbers that are multiples of 3. 

    The program must use a for loop to traverse the list and a control flow structure to filter the numbers.
